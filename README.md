# CreditCardFraudDetection
This is my take on kaggle competition of detecting fraudulent credit card transaction using Machine and Deep learning techniques.

 Card fraud losses are a huge problem. The Nilson Report, a publication covering global payment systems, reported recently that global card fraud losses equaled $22.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 4.4 percent over 2015.

Leveraging Machine learning and Deep learning techniques will enable payment vendors to identify fradulent transaction and can come up with counter measures to stop them and can save a lot of money.

This is a classification problem since the transaction is going to be fradulent or not. The dataset I used for the below problem is a real dataset but anonymized for privacy reasons and the same can be downloaded on Kaggle.
